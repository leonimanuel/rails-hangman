# Hangman with Friends

Challenge your friends to a game of hangman

# Installation

Fork and clone this repo.

Once opened, execute:

	$ bundle install

This app shines when it has multiple users. To seed the database, run:

	$ rails db:seed

To start the server, execute:

	$ rails s

Open the index.html in your browser. You can sign up as a new user, but I suggest logging in as an existing user to get the full experience (email: billy@aol.com, password: greenbeans)
